Selling some furniture that doesn't make sense in our new place! All prices negotiable.

1. 9'x12' Heathered Chennile / Jute Rug in Indigo with rug pad. $100

Love this rug, but it doesn't fit color scheme or size wise in our new home. It's a jute rug but a little softer / plusher than most jute rugs. Very durable and easy to clean.

It's this [rug](https://www.potterybarn.com/products/heathered-chenille-jute-rug-natural/) from Pottery Barn, but in a blue color. [Rug pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007T58QPA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is my favorite felt + latex 1/4 inch thick rug pad that adds quite a bit of cushion while keeping the rug non slip. Retails new for $1000 + shipping. All rolled up and ready to pick up.

2. Purple felt armchairs! Two! $40 for both, $60 for one. Yes. I really want you to take both.

See those purple chairs in the previous photo? Well they're for sale too! These purple felt armchairs with wicker sides are comfy, vintage, and good vibes. They've faded quite a bit in the sun but that just adds to their charm. Both are in excellent condition for their age minus the fading. 

Dimensions: 27'' wide x 28'' deep x 30'' tall.
